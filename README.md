# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Ezra Samuel. 
I am on the path of becoming a data analyst. 
I am currently learning python and sql. 
I know coding can be tasking sometimes, but I have realized overtime that commitment can help us achieve whatever we want to achieve. 
I will do my best in that regard.
